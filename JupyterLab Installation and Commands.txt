How to Configure Jupyter:

Additional kernels can be installed into the shared jupyter directory
  /usr/local/etc/jupyter

Bash completion has been installed to:
  /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d

To start jupyterlab now and restart at login:
  brew services start jupyterlab
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  /usr/local/opt/jupyterlab/bin/jupyter-lab
==> guile
Guile libraries can now be installed here:
    Source files: /usr/local/share/guile/site/3.0
  Compiled files: /usr/local/lib/guile/3.0/site-ccache
      Extensions: /usr/local/lib/guile/3.0/extensions

Add the following to your .bashrc or equivalent:
  export GUILE_LOAD_PATH="/usr/local/share/guile/site/3.0"
  export GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH="/usr/local/lib/guile/3.0/site-ccache"
  export GUILE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS_PATH="/usr/local/lib/guile/3.0/extensions"
